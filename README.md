# Jekyll Datachart

Jekyll Datachart is my first own jekyll plugin for octopress. You can easily embed data charts with pace and elevation that you recorded in a tcx-file (gpx, kml later?).

##How it works

Installation / Configuration
============================

To use this plugin you need coffeescript, add it to your Gemfile

	source "http://rubygems.org"

	group :development do
	  gem 'coffee-script', '~> 2.2.0'
	end

Then update your bundle

	bundle

Second, you need Highcharts JS (Free for non-commercial)

	http://www.highcharts.com/

Put the highcharts.js into your 'source/javascripts' directory.
	
Put the contents of 'plugins' in your 'source/plugins' directory and the contents of 'source' in your 'source' directory (just copy the directories if you don't have those directories yet).
	
Put the following configuration in your _config.yml

	# data charting
	datachart:
			dimensions:
					   width: 750
					   height: 200

Include {% include jekyll_datachart.html %} in your head.html

	<head>
		...

		{% capture canonical %}{{ site.url }}{% if site.permalink contains '.html' %}{{ page.url }}{% else %}{{ page.url | remove:'index.html' }}{% endif %}{% endcapture %}
		<link rel="canonical" href="{{ canonical }}">
		<link href="{{ root_url }}/favicon.png" rel="icon">
		<link href="{{ root_url }}/stylesheets/screen.css" media="screen, projection" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css">

		{% include jekyll_datachart.html %}

		<script src="{{ root_url }}/javascripts/modernizr-2.0.js"></script>
		<script src="{{ root_url }}/javascripts/ender.js"></script>
		<script src="{{ root_url }}/javascripts/octopress.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
		<link href="{{ site.subscribe_rss }}" rel="alternate" title="{{site.title}}" type="application/atom+xml">
		{% include custom/head.html %}
		{% include google_analytics.html %}

		...
	</head>

Usage
=====

Set the relevant values in your pages and posts (first version of this plugin understands only tcx files, next verson understands gpx and kml too):

	datachart:
		files:
			- http://yourfirstfile.tcx
			- http://yoursecondfile.tcx

Include the render_datachart tag in your posts:

    {{% render_datachart %}

Optionally, you can specify the width and height:
    
    {% render_datachart 500,500 %}

## What's next ?

* More formats: gpx and kml
* Any more ideas? ...
